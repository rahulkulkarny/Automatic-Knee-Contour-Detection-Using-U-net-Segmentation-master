# Automatic-Knee-Contour-Detection-Using-U-net-Segmentation
This project uses U-Net to automate femur bone contour extraction in knee X-rays, aiding surgeons' decision-making. Manual annotation is time-consuming and repetitive, making deep learning a valuable solution. The model improves efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, reducing effort in surgical planning. This has been done using U-net based BioMedical Image Segmentation approach for Knee X-rays to automate contour extraction on femur bone
